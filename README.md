 - No comment on this yet, but it looks like a Vitalik Buterin could be the right person to figure everything out for us: "Blockchain voting is overrated among uninformed people but underrated among informed people" https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/25/voting2.html  


## Voting systems
 
 ### Nano  
 - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/nle3sh/oc_nano_cryptocurrency_live_transaction_voting/gzjkmo6/">Nano (cryptocurrency) live transaction voting visualization</a> u/numso - "Crytpcurrencies need a consensus algorithm. Nano uses an unique way to achieve consensus which is called Open Representative Voting. In this graph, every small block is a transaction being validated by representatives (computers in a distributed network). Individual blocks move higher up on the graph towards a constant quorum. When they reach the top, the transaction is considered valid and confirmed. Each representative holds a variable amount of vote weight so the blocks must reach the quorum by collecting votes from several different representatives."  
 
 ### EOS
