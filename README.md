## Projects in development  

### Algorand  
 
 - According to this Reddit post, apparently what we need are "Zero Knowledge proofs" - "Voting and Governance: If you want to have privacy in voting you likely want ZK Proofs. If you want to prevent users from being able to retain proof of who they voted for and still prove consistency and correctness of the voting process, you want ZK Proofs." https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rwwx6x/silvio_micali_founder_of_algorand_won_the_turing/hrgm51k/    


### Nano  
 - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/nle3sh/oc_nano_cryptocurrency_live_transaction_voting/gzjkmo6/">Nano (cryptocurrency) live transaction voting visualization</a> u/numso - "Crytpcurrencies need a consensus algorithm. Nano uses an unique way to achieve consensus which is called Open Representative Voting. In this graph, every small block is a transaction being validated by representatives (computers in a distributed network). Individual blocks move higher up on the graph towards a constant quorum. When they reach the top, the transaction is considered valid and confirmed. Each representative holds a variable amount of vote weight so the blocks must reach the quorum by collecting votes from several different representatives."  
 
### EOS  
 - "Follow my vote" is attempting to do a mock US presidential election with EOS. The identity verification element doesn't seem to be much of an advancement unfortunately: https://followmyvote.com/blockchain-voting-the-end-to-end-process/  
 - https://github.com/EOSIO/eos  
 - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8ty13c/we_have_suffered_a_private_affair_block_producer/e1b6bga/">some controversy</a> but I think Cryptoverse summarized the issue as a growing pain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU6xeFSMgpI  
 
### IOTA

 - https://twitter.com/pryszkie/status/966320527257296898  
 
### Google votes  
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhVR7gFMKNg and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UqV3eN9Pa8  
   - I am confused as to where the code is located? The video says go/googlevotes but it could also refer to Google plus polls?

 - No comment on this yet, but it looks like a Vitalik Buterin could be the right person to figure everything out for us: "Blockchain voting is overrated among uninformed people but underrated among informed people" https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/25/voting2.html
